# ng-cast: a new $scope

## Staff Onbaording

It is highly recommended that prior to the sprint (and if not done so already) that all student-facing staff go through the sprint as a student. That means:

- read this document
- Watching the intro Video and read slides (see syllabus)
- Attempt (some of) the tutorials
- Watch the Core Concepts lecture
- Attempt the sprint, following the sprint readme
- Watch the Solution Lecture

## Background 

### v1 vs v2+

Angular1 (commonly referred to as `AngularJS`) is a front-end only framework. It is still in use today (even for new projects) and has a huge legacy code base.

Angular2+ (commonly referred to as `Angular`) is a full-stack framework based on the language of TypeScript. Many of the ideas used in this sprint are directly applicable to Angular2+ codebases. 

The sprint `ng-cast` is a re-write of the sprint to make use of modern Angular concepts without needing to teach and make use of TypeScript.

## Context

It's very important that teaching teams prefix this week with a discussion about how similar many MVC frameworks are: they are all based in a component centric mindset but have varying levels of opinion about how to implement those components. A good place for this discussion is during the Front-End concepts lecture.

Similarities:
- Backbone View
- React Components
- Angular Directives
